# megaioind-rpi

This is the Codesys driver to control the Old Industrial and Building Automation I/O Expansion cards for Raspberry Pi.

Once install “MEGAIO-IND.package” an example project is created in your user directory. The example detects the board type you are connected to and activate 4-20mA in/out or resistor in channels accordingly. In the same directory you will find the library and device descriptor (xml) if you want to change the functionality of the driver.
